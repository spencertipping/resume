# TeX resume
Feel free to use this as a starting point for building a resume in TeX (MIT
license as usual).

## Compiling
On Ubuntu:

```sh
$ apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-extra
$ pdflatex resume.tex
```

## Design
I haven't historically had many opinions about how a resume should be designed,
but since reviewing candidate resumes I've developed a few:

1. **Keep it objective; don't have a voice.** I got brag-blind after a dozen or
   so resumes because they were narrated to demonstrate how awesome the
   candidate was but didn't give me anything I could use to substantiate that
   claim. Be informative rather than persuasive.
2. **Use short, mnemonic, printable links.** Even though a lot of resume review
   happens on a screen, review tools don't make it easy to click through to the
   resume itself. If I'm intrigued by something, make it as simple as possible
   for me to learn more.
3. **Open source is a career.** Hopefully it's your longest one and the one
   that says the most about you; I put it at the top of my resume for those
   reasons.

I've tried to implement these here (item 2 is easier if you own a domain, which
I recommend in general -- doesn't have to be your name as long as it's easy to
remember).

## Please complain
Someone's job search might be predicated on this repo offering a sensible
starting point, so if it's suboptimal I want to know what should be fixed.
Strongly-worded suggestions are welcome:

- [Issues](https://github.com/spencertipping/resume/issues/new)
- [@spencertipping](https://twitter.com/spencertipping)
- [spencer.tipping@gmail.com](mailto:spencer.tipping@gmail.com)

I'll keep a [log](feedback.md) of these suggestions and what changed as a
result.
